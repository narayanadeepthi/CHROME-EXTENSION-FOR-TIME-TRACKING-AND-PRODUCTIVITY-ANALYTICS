#DESCRIPTION

Our Chrome extension, dubbed "Productivity Tracker," is designed to help users optimize their browsing habits and boost productivity. By tracking the time spent on various websites, the extension provides valuable insights into how users allocate their time online. The extension's backend stores user data securely, while the intuitive dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of productivity analytics.

Upon installation, the extension prompts users to create an account, ensuring that their data remains confidential. As users navigate the web, the extension unobtrusively tracks the time spent on each website. This data is then categorized into productive and unproductive segments, based on predefined classifications. For instance, coding platforms like GitHub or Stack Overflow are deemed productive, while social media sites like Facebook or Twitter are labeled unproductive.

The extension's dashboard is the central hub for users to access their productivity analytics. The intuitive interface displays a wealth of information, including:

- Time Distribution: A graphical representation of the time spent on productive versus unproductive websites.
- Top Productive Sites: A list of the most frequently visited productive websites, along with the total time spent on each.
- Top Unproductive Sites: A list of the most frequently visited unproductive websites, along with the total time spent on each.
- Weekly Productivity Report: A comprehensive report highlighting the user's productivity trends over the past week.

Armed with these insights, users can make informed decisions about their online habits, setting goals to optimize their productivity. The extension also allows users to customize the classification of websites, ensuring that the productivity analytics align with their individual needs.

To further enhance the user experience, our extension incorporates various features, including:

- Customizable Alerts: Users can set alerts to notify them when they've spent a predetermined amount of time on unproductive websites.
- Goal Setting: Users can establish productivity goals, such as spending a certain amount of time on productive websites or limiting time spent on unproductive sites.
- Data Export: Users can export their productivity data to CSV files, enabling them to analyze their habits in external tools or spreadsheets.

By providing a comprehensive productivity tracking solution, our Chrome extension empowers users to take control of their online habits, optimize their productivity, and achieve their goals.
